# Rubric for the Human-Centered Deign Project


Each group will have 10 minutes of presentation and 10 minutes of discussion about the project. 


Talk about the two phases:

- Inspiration phase:The interviews - what did you ask and what response did you get? What were some of your first ideas and how did the project transform/change? Why?
- Prototyping: What is your prototype? (Show images/videos!) How did you test it? (Talk about reflections. What did you observe people do? What did they tell you about the experience? Did you see them struggling with anything and how did they resolve the issue? Did this give you ideas about your next prototype (if you were to do one, theoretically)? Did you "How Might We Statement" change at all?
