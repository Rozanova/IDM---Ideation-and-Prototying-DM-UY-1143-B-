# Narrative Timeline of Influences

*Make sure you watch <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series" target="_blank">Everything Is A Remix</a> before embarking on this assignment.*

As research for your future utopia / dystopia project, create an evolution timeline by making one of the following:

*   an infographic as a pdf (post on your process website) **OR** 
*	another video documentary 1 to 3 minutes in length, post on vimeo or youtube, and embed on your process website **OR** 
*	an interactive data visualization and embed within your process website.

The timeline should reflect:
* an object or experience that relates to your framing story or message for your future Dystopia / Utopia project 

In other words, show the past history of an existing object or experience (as in how it evolved from when it was first made to how it is now). The timeline should contain **at least** 3 iterations if not more.

Post the timeline to your Process site
